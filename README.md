## 💻 Local Development Setup

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sam721166/timmo.git
cd timmo
```

### 2. Set up the Backend
1. Navigate to the `backend` folder:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```
2. Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory:
   ```env
   MONGO_URI="mongodb://localhost:27017/timmo"
   JWT_SECRET="yourSecret123"
   PORT=3000
   ```
3. Start the backend server in development mode:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### 3. Set up the Frontend
1. Navigate to the `frontend` folder:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```
2. Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory:
   ```env
   BACKEND_URL="http://localhost:3000"
   ```
3. Start the Vite development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

## 🌐 Production Deployment

### Backend (Deployed on Render)
1. Hosted on a persistent server (e.g., Render Web Service).
2. Set up environment variables: `MONGO_URI` (pointing to a MongoDB Atlas cluster) and `JWT_SECRET`.
3. Configure **CORS** in `backend/app.js` to allow requests originating from your frontend Vercel domain.

### Frontend (Deployed on Vercel)
1. Hosted on Vercel with the **Root Directory** set to `frontend`.
2. Vercel automatically detects the Vite preset and builds the application output into the `dist` directory.
3. Uses a reverse proxy in `vercel.json` to route `/api/*` requests directly to the backend Render app, bypassing CORS restrictions:

```json
{
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/api/:path*",
      "destination": "https://your-backend-app.onrender.com/api/:path*"
    },
    {
      "source": "/((?!api/).*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```
